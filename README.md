You need an OBD wifi adapter connected to the same wifi network on OBD and Nav unit.

To install APK you need have hacked yout Nav unit.


To compile this APK you need to extract IVI libraries from your Nav unit. com.lge.ivi.jar must be in externallibs folder. It is not legal so don't ask me about the way to do it.
